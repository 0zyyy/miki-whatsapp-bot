# I changed my mind...

It's been too long since I created this repository. Many things have changed since then, including my mind.

Some of the changes from the initial plan:

-   All documentations are in English. Of course.
-   Bot no longer use MongoDB. Instead it'll use a plain JSON database and I have created a backup mechanism.
-   Bot no longer use NLP. It's ugly and takes too long to process!

# Anyway, Welcome!

It's a pain to write texts for computer and human at the same time...
